<h1>Hadamard Matrix Generator</h1>

Here we have implemented the `Hadamard Matrix Generator` in 3 Different Programming Languages. `Java`, `C++`, and `Python`

<h2>How to use in Java</h2>
You need to add `HadamardMatriceGenerator.java` class in the project package, or you can import it in the considered Java Class.
then you can use it like this :

`HadamardMatriceGenerator hmg = new HadamardMatriceGenerator();`

`int h[][] = hmd.Generator(3);`

then you will have the third hadamarad matrix in the array h
